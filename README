Description
===========

Tiny Vectors provides a "reasonably" efficient implementation of vector
algebra in 3 dimensions, along with dot and cross product
operators. Vectors are implemented using triples (see the Tuples package).

Status
======

Tiny Vectors should be usable for day-to-day work. However, as with any new
package, there may be latent coding erros. Furthermore, breaking changes to
the language/API may occur without notice.

Installation
============

Tiny Vectors is packaged as a Chicken Scheme Egg. Installation of Tiny
Vectors should be a simple matter of downloading a copy of the source tree,
and then installing using the chicken-install program.
